The output of the program will be 4.

Explanation:

When the program is compiled and run, the following sequence of operations takes place:

The preprocessor replaces the macro square(4) with 4*4, giving the line i = 64/4*4;.

According to the precedence rules of C, the multiplication is performed before the division, so this expression is equivalent to i = (64/4) * 4;.

The division 64/4 evaluates to 16, so the expression becomes i = 16 * 4;.

The multiplication is performed, and the value 64 is assigned to the variable i.

The printf() function is called with the argument "64", which is printed to the console.

So, the output of the program is 64/16 = 4.
