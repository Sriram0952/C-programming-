The output of the code will be 14.

In the code, the value of the second element of the array arr is first retrieved using arr[1]. Then, the second element of arr is assigned the value 2 using (arr[1]=2). The expression arr[1] returns the value 2, which is added to the original value retrieved earlier, resulting in 12 + 2 = 14. Therefore, the value of x becomes 14 and is printed using printf().
