Predict the output or error(s) for the following program: void main() { int const * p=5; printf("%d",++(*p)); } 

The program has undefined behavior because it attempts to modify a constant value, which is not allowed.

The declaration int const * p = 5; creates a pointer p to a constant integer value 5. The const keyword indicates that the value pointed to by p cannot be modified.

The expression ++(*p) attempts to increment the value pointed to by p. However, since the value is declared as const, this is not allowed and will result in undefined behavior.

Therefore, it is not possible to predict the output or error(s) for this program.
