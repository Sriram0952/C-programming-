pointere to predict the output or error(s) for this program.

￼￼

Predict the output or error(s) for the following program: main() { int c[ ]={2.8,3.4,4,6.7,5}; int j,*p=c,*q=c; for(j=0;j<5;j++) { printf(" %d ",*c); ++q; } for(j=0;j<5;j++){ printf(" %d ",*p); ++p; } } 

The program has several errors and will not compile successfully.

First, the array c is declared as an array of integers, but the first element is initialized with a floating-point value 2.8. This is not allowed and will result in a compiler error.

Second, the pointer p is initialized with the address of the array c, but it is declared as a pointer to an integer, not an array. To fix this, the declaration should be int *p = c;.

Third, the loop that uses the variable q to print the values of the array does not actually use q. Instead, it should be using the pointer q to print the values.

Finally, the loop that prints the values of the array using p will print the same value five times, because p is incremented in each iteration but is not used to access the array. To fix this, we can use the index j to access the elements of the array, like this: printf(" %d ", p[j]);.
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int c[] = {2, 3, 4, 6, 5};
    int j, *p = c, *q = c;
    
    for (j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
        printf(" %d ", *q);
        ++q;
    }
    
    for (j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
        printf(" %d ", p[j]);
    }
    
    return 0;
}
